# Convert SVG to JSX

This plugin replaces SVG attributes with their JSX-valid equivalents and deletes common JSX-invalid attribute strings.

## When is this useful?
- If you're working on a React project with a lot of manual SVG manipulation.
- If you're tired of repetitive find + replacing on the SVG assets pasted from Sketch or Illustrator.

## When is this not useful?
- If you want to load SVGs to use directly as React components. Try https://github.com/jhamlet/svg-react-loader.
- Many other situations.
